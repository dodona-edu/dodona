        <p class="lead">For a correct operation of Dodona, it is necessary to keep track of some data about our users. On this page, we explain what data we store, why we need that data, and who has access to the data. If you have any further questions, don’t hesitate to <%= link_to "contact us", contact_path %>.</p>
        <h2>Personal data</h2>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-lg-7">
            <p>When signing into Dodona, we exclusively use the authentication system of your school or institution. Examples of these are Smartschool and Office 365 for secondary education and SAML for higher education. This means that under no circumstances, Dodona gets access to your password. What we do get access to when signing in are your <b>name</b>, <b>username</b> and <b>email address</b>. We need these data to correctly identify you and to be able to contact you in case of any problems. Next to that, we also store the <b>institution</b> you used to sign in, your <b>preferred language</b> and your <b>local timezone</b>. Your timezone is needed to correctly display any deadlines set by  courses.</p>
            <p>You can check these data for yourself on your personal profile page. Your profile is also visible for the teachers of the courses you subscribed to.</p>

        <h2>Dodona-specific data</h2>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-lg-7">
            <p>By using Dodona, you also generate additional Dodona-specific data which we store for the correct operation of the platform. For example, we need to keep track of all <b>courses</b> you’re subscribed to and which submissions you made. For each submission, in addition to your <b>submitted code</b>, we also store the <b>result</b> and <b>time of submission</b>.</p>
            <p>An overview of all submissions can be seen on <%= link_to "this overview page", submissions_path %>. All submissions for exercises within a specific course can also be seen by all teachers of that course. For some exercises, part of the generated feedback is only visible to the teachers.</p>

        <h2>Data processing</h2>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-lg-7">
            <p>We have the ambition to transform Dodona into an intelligent platform that optimally supports students in acquiring programming skills. We could do this, for example, by offering dynamic learning paths and by recommending exercises about a specific topic or of a certain difficulty. At the same time, we wish to give teachers insight into the progress of their students to enable them to optimise their teaching.</p>
            <p>To develop and eventually provide these functionalities, it is necessary to (automatically) process the available data, for example using machine learning. When doing this, the data will always be pseudonymised and in many cases aggregated. Using this de-identification procedure, your personal data will be decoupled from your submissions and not be processed. By doing this, the risk of unwanted identification of people within Dodona is minimised.</p>
            <p>Insights acquired from using and developing these innovative educational technologies can be published as scientific research. Within this context, we will never share or publish data that would allow to the identification of individual users unless explicit permission is given.</p>

        <h2>Technical support</h2>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-lg-7">
            <p>To safeguard the availability of Dodona, it is necessary to monitor the status of our servers. This means, for example, that we keep track of the load of individual machines, and that we use heavily aggregated data to keep an eye on the length of the submissions queue and the number of active users.</p>
            <p>Individual servers also keep log files of all activity on those machines. These files are kept for a maximum of 7 days and are only accessible to the platform administrators. Platform administrators can also request specific data on Dodona itself. As with the log files, these data are only accessed in the event of problems or to make technical adjustments.</p>
