    <p>If a user signs in using <b>a known identity provider</b> for the first time, an account is created <b>automatically</b>.</p>
    <p>Manual account creation is <b>only</b> needed if a student doesn't have an account yet with a known identity provider. In that case, you can manually create an account for them. After creation, be sure to <b>send</b> the special <b>sign in link</b> to the respective student. If the student eventually obtains an account with a known identity provider, they should send an email to you with their username or email address. Be sure to add that username or email address to their account so they can sign in using their identity provider.</p>
    <p>If you create an account, be sure to enter a <b>first name</b>, <b>last name</b> and <b>email address</b>.</p>
