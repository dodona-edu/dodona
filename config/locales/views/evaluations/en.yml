      explanation_html: "<p>Evaluating a series is a structured way to give feedback on all submitted solutions of a series. Dodona keeps track of which submissions are already checked, so you can easily split work between multiple course administrators. The feedback you give isn't immediately visible for the students; you can decide when it is released.</p><p>You can find a guide with more information about evaluating exercises in Dodona <a href=\"https://docs.dodona.be/en/guides/teachers/grading/\">in our documentation</a>.</p>"
