      intro_p1_html: "Dodona is an online exercise platform for <strong>learning to code</strong>. It wants to teach students how to program in the most meaningful and effective way possible. Dodona acts as an <strong>online co-teacher</strong>, designed to give every student access to high quality education. The focus is on automatic corrections and giving meaningful feedback on the <strong>submitted solutions</strong> from students."
